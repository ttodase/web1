<h2>소고_2</h2>
<p>
  Since its founding in 1994 by Web Inventor Tim Berners-Lee,<br>
  the World Wide Web Consortium has developed the foundational technical<br>
  standards upon which the Web has flourished. <br>
  The Web and its place in society have changed dramatically,<br>
  and the Web Consortium has been at the core of its technical interoperability.<br>
  Today we need a more dramatic transformation to address <br>
  the opportunities and threats<br>
  the Web now faces and to continue to shape its future constructively.<br>
